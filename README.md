🚀 What’s Inside

The repo is structured by topic and exercise sets (e.g., part01, part02, …, part14), each folder containing multiple solution files that illustrate:
	•	Fundamentals: variables, types, conditionals, loops, I/O
	•	Data Structures: lists, dictionaries, tuples, strings
	•	Functions & Modules: defining functions, lambda expressions, generators
	•	OOP: classes, methods, inheritance, encapsulation
	•	Recursion & Backtracking
	•	List Comprehensions & Functional Programming
	•	File I/O & Error Handling
	•	Pygame Projects: animation, event handling, multiple games

🛠️ How to Explore
	1.	Clone the Repository
  2.	Navigate by Module
Each partXX folder contains the related exercise files.
	3.	Run in Your Environment
Simply execute any .py file with Python 3:

🎯 Who Is This For?
	•	Learners: Visualize step-by-step solutions to course exercises.
	•	Self‑Checkers: Compare your code to these solutions and refine your understanding.
	•	Project Inspiration: Turn smaller exercises into larger, bespoke projects.
